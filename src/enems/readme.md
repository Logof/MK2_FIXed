Here before there was a * setter *. Now in `..\utils\` you have a * setter *, which is more better and therefore less worse.

Write in your terminal

`` ''
..\utils\ponedor
`` ''

and follow the instructions. You will appreciate it, especially if you have suffered the Setter.

You don't need more, setter.exe uses the same resources as setter - with some extras, like supporting `* .png` for the tileset.
